# ðŸ’¯ 100 Days of RTL Coding

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfRTL** challenge â€” a dedicated journey into the world of **Register Transfer Level (RTL) design**, **Digital Electronics**, and **Hardware Description Languages (HDLs)** like **Verilog**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this challenge is to:
- Deepen my understanding of RTL design and digital circuits.
- Practice Verilog by building and simulating small modules daily.
- Share insights, designs, and learning with the broader tech community.
- Create a valuable resource for anyone starting out in RTL/FPGA design.

ðŸ§¡ *In this 100 Days challenge, Iâ€™ll try my level best to fulfill this goal. If I ever miss a day, Iâ€™ll surely upload the content the next day without fail!*

## ðŸ“… Challenge Duration

**Start Date:** May 27, 2025  

## ðŸ§  What Iâ€™ll Be Doing

Each day, I will:
- Design a small RTL module or logic circuit.
- Simulate it using tools like **ModelSim**, **IntelQuartusPrime**, or **vivado**.
- Upload the Verilog code with comments and simulation/testbench files.
- Write a short explanation of what the module does and how it works.

## ðŸ§© What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Each day, you'll find:
- A Verilog module (.v) with proper comments
- A testbench file to simulate the design
- Simulation waveforms 
- Schematics diagrams
